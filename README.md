# Cardiolytics AI Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the development roadmap for Cardiolytics Ai, which aims to provide insightful heart rate data visualizations and health analytics by leveraging Apple HealthKit.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Planning and Design
- **Goal**: Define app features, create design mockups, and plan the development process.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Define core functionalities and integration points with HealthKit.
  - [ ] Create wireframes for the app's user interface.
  - [ ] Develop a detailed design mockup for key screens.
  - [ ] Write technical specifications and determine the tech stack.

### Phase 2: Environment Setup and Basic HealthKit Integration
- **Goal**: Set up the development environment and implement basic HealthKit integration.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Install and configure Xcode.
  - [ ] Initialize a new Swift project in Xcode.
  - [ ] Implement basic HealthKit integration to read heart rate data.

### Phase 3: MVP Development
- **Goal**: Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with basic heart rate visualization.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Develop UI components based on design mockups.
  - [ ] Create a module to fetch and process heart rate data from HealthKit.
  - [ ] Implement data visualization for heart rate metrics.
  - [ ] Integrate user authentication and permissions for HealthKit data access.

### Phase 4: Testing and Iteration
- **Goal**: Test the MVP and iterate based on feedback.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Perform unit testing and functional testing.
  - [ ] Conduct user testing with a small group.
  - [ ] Gather feedback and iterate on the MVP.

### Phase 5: App Store Preparation and Submission
- **Goal**: Prepare for and submit the app to the Apple App Store.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Optimize app performance and fix any remaining bugs.
  - [ ] Prepare App Store listing, including screenshots and descriptions.
  - [ ] Submit the app for review through Xcode.
  - [ ] Address any feedback or required changes from the App Store review.

### Phase 6: Post-Launch Activities
- **Goal**: Monitor, maintain, and update the app post-launch.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Monitor app performance and user feedback.
  - [ ] Plan and implement app updates and new features.
  - [ ] Implement marketing and user engagement strategies.
